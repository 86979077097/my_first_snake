This is a copy of the game "Snake" that I made in my last year of high school. I built it from scratch, and I know the code might be hard to understand because, at the time, I didn't think I would ever post it anywhere. I may provide an explanation for it in the future.

The framework I used for this is called SDL.

I do not own a license for the game; I simply recreated it based on what I observed it does.
